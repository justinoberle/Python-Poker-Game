# Python-Poker-Game
poker.py can play through a full hand with x number of players and pick the winning hand.
test_poker.py will run this through a loop x iterations to debug and also plots some statistics. For now, it plots the percentage of time each hand has won. I will add to this for future.
Things in the works are preflop hand wins. Which hands are best preflop? Which are worst? Plot this against number of players also to see how it varies.
Once this is complete, start a new py script for machine learning purposes.
Possibly add some betting/folding logic also.
